# MoodSky ⛅

MoodSky is a beginner-friendly weather app built during my SheCodes learning journey. It shows the current weather and a 3-day forecast for any city, using real-time data from the SheCodes Weather API. 🌍

## 🔍 About the Project

This project is more than a weather app—it's the start of my journey into UX design with a strong focus on accessibility and inclusion, especially for neurodivergent users.

As someone with a background in psychology, I’m passionate about creating digital spaces that are emotionally intuitive, visually calming, and cognitively accessible.

## 🧠 UX Design Intentions

- Minimal distractions: Clean layout with clear sections and spacing.
- Consistent visual cues: Colors and weather icons support cognitive recognition (emoji + text).
- Accessible typography: Large, readable font sizes and high contrast for users with dyslexia or visual processing challenges.
- Mood-driven design: Backgrounds and themes reflect emotional cues tied to weather (with dark mode support).

## 🛠️ Built With

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Axios for API calls
- SheCodes Weather API
- Hosted on Netlify

## 🎯 Future UX Improvements

- Voice feedback or narration for visually impaired users.
- Toggle for simplified language or text-to-symbol options.
- Mood journal or tracker tied to weather changes.
- Colorblind-safe theme toggles.

## 💡 Why Neurodivergence?

Neurodivergent individuals often face unnecessary complexity in everyday tech. Whether it’s ADHD, autism, dyslexia, or anxiety—MoodSky aims to gently acknowledge their needs through design that reduces cognitive load and enhances emotional comfort.
